# Create Handoff Documentation

I'll create comprehensive handoff documentation to ensure smooth context transfer.

## Gathering Current State...

### 1. Reading Project Context:
First, let me check the current project state and identify active work:

```bash
# Check if context directory exists
if [ ! -d "context" ]; then
    echo "❌ No context directory found. Please run /ccmagic:init first."
    exit 1
fi

# Check current git branch and status
git branch --show-current
git status --short
```

Loading project files:
- `context/project.md` - Project overview
- `context/working-state.md` - Current status
- `context/conventions.md` - Team standards

### 2. Identifying Active Work:

Reading current task and feature state:
- Checking `context/working-state.md` for current epic/feature/task
- Looking for active tasks in `context/features/*/tasks/current/`
- Checking feature-specific working states

```bash
# Find current task
find context/features/*/tasks/current -name "*.md" -type f 2>/dev/null | head -1
```

### 3. Analyzing Recent Activity:

```bash
# Get recent commits (last 10)
echo "📝 Recent Commits:"
git log --oneline -10

# Show uncommitted changes
echo "📊 Uncommitted Changes:"
git status --porcelain

# Check for stashed work
echo "📦 Stashed Work:"
git stash list
```

### 4. Reading Task Progress:

If a current task exists, loading:
- Task description and acceptance criteria
- Progress against acceptance criteria
- Time spent and estimates
- Any blockers or issues

### 5. Checking Test and Build Status:

```bash
# Check if tests are configured and their last status
if [ -f "package.json" ]; then
    # For Node.js projects
    echo "🧪 Test Status:"
    npm test --silent 2>/dev/null && echo "✅ Tests passing" || echo "❌ Tests failing or not configured"
elif [ -f "Cargo.toml" ]; then
    # For Rust projects
    cargo test --quiet 2>/dev/null && echo "✅ Tests passing" || echo "❌ Tests failing"
elif [ -f "go.mod" ]; then
    # For Go projects
    go test ./... 2>/dev/null && echo "✅ Tests passing" || echo "❌ Tests failing"
fi
```

## Creating Handoff Document

Based on the gathered information, I'll create a detailed handoff document.

```

## Quick Handoff Option

For rapid handoffs (use with argument "quick"):
- Creates condensed version with essential info only
- Focuses on: current state, blockers, next steps
- Skips: detailed metrics, session notes, extensive context
- Good for: daily standups, quick team switches

## Best Practices

1. **Create handoffs regularly**: End of day, before breaks, when switching tasks
2. **Be specific**: Include exact commands, file paths, and next steps
3. **Document blockers clearly**: Include who can help resolve them
4. **Update before pushing**: Ensure handoff reflects latest changes
5. **Commit with the handoff**: Keep documentation in sync with code
