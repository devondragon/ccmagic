# Create Spike Task

## Creating a New Spike...

I'll help you create a time-boxed research or investigation task (spike).

### 1. Checking Context Structure:

```bash
# Ensure context directory exists
if [ ! -d "context" ]; then
    echo "‚ùå Context directory not found. Run /init first."
    exit 1
fi

# Ensure spike directories exist
mkdir -p context/spikes/todo
mkdir -p context/spikes/current
mkdir -p context/spikes/completed
```

### 2. Determining Spike ID:

```bash
# Find next available spike ID
EXISTING_SPIKES=$(find context/spikes -name "spike-*.md" -type f 2>/dev/null | \
                  grep -oE "spike-[0-9]{3}" | \
                  grep -oE "[0-9]{3}" | \
                  sort -n | tail -1)

if [ -z "$EXISTING_SPIKES" ]; then
    NEXT_ID="001"
else
    NEXT_ID=$(printf "%03d" $((10#$EXISTING_SPIKES + 1)))
fi

echo "üìå Next spike ID: spike-$NEXT_ID"
```

üöÄ Next Actions:
   1. Review spike details in file
   2. Schedule spike in sprint/week
   3. Run `/start-spike spike-{{id}}` when ready
   
Created successfully! The spike is now in your backlog.
```

### 11. Spike Management Commands:

```markdown
## Related Commands

After creating the spike, use:

- `/start-spike spike-{{id}}` - Begin working on spike
- `/list-spikes` - View all spikes by status
- `/complete-spike spike-{{id}}` - Finish spike with findings
- `/extend-spike spike-{{id}}` - Request time box extension
- `/convert-spike spike-{{id}}` - Convert findings to tasks
```

## Smart Features:

### Auto-Suggestions:
- Suggests related spikes based on description
- Recommends time box based on spike type
- Proposes questions based on common patterns
- Links to relevant knowledge base articles

### Integration Points:
- Links to existing epics/features/tasks
- Cross-references with backlog items
- Connects to issue tracking system
- Updates project risk register

### Quality Checks:
- Warns if time box exceeds 8 hours
- Validates questions are specific and measurable
- Ensures success criteria are clear
- Checks for duplicate spikes

## Best Practices Enforcement:

1. **Time Box Limits**: Maximum 8 hours (1 day) recommended
2. **Clear Questions**: Each question should be answerable
3. **Defined Success**: Clear criteria for completion
4. **Documentation**: Findings must be recorded
5. **Follow-through**: Creates tasks from recommendations

## Error Handling:

- **Duplicate spike**: Show similar spikes and ask to proceed
- **No context directory**: Prompt to run `/init`
- **Invalid time box**: Suggest appropriate range
- **Missing required fields**: Interactive prompts for completion

The spike creation system ensures research and investigation work is properly planned, time-boxed, and documented!
