# Initialize CCMagic Project

I'll initialize the complete CCMagic context structure for your project with full epics, features, and knowledge management capabilities.

## Creating Directory Structure

### Creating directories:

```bash
# Core directories
mkdir -p context

# Epic and feature management
mkdir -p context/epics
mkdir -p context/features

# Spikes for one-off research/investigation tasks
mkdir -p context/spikes/todo
mkdir -p context/spikes/current
mkdir -p context/spikes/completed

# Knowledge base
mkdir -p context/knowledge

# Session tracking
mkdir -p context/sessions/handoffs
```

## Branching Strategy Configuration

Before creating the context structure, let me ask about your team's git workflow preferences:

### Select Your Branching Strategy:

**Option A: Hierarchical Branches** (Recommended for teams)
- Feature branches from base branch
- Task branches from feature branches  
- Flow: base ‚Üí feature ‚Üí task ‚Üí feature ‚Üí base
- Best for: teams, complex features, clean history

**Option B: Direct Task Branches**
- Task branches directly from base branch
- Each task merges directly back to base
- Simpler but less organized
- Best for: small features, hotfixes, rapid development

**Option C: Single Feature Branch**  
- Feature branches from base branch
- All tasks committed directly on feature branch
- PR when entire feature complete
- Best for: solo developers, simple features

Please tell me which strategy (A, B, or C) you prefer, and I'll configure the project accordingly.

### Select Your Base Branch:

What is your main development branch?
- **main** (GitHub default, modern standard)
- **develop** (GitFlow pattern)
- **master** (Legacy projects)
- **Custom** (Please specify)

I'll use your selections to create a `context/branching.md` configuration file that all git-related commands will reference.

## Creating Core Files

### 1. Creating `context/branching.md`:
Based on your selections above, I'll create:
```markdown
# Branching Configuration

## Selected Strategy
**Strategy**: [Your selection: A, B, or C]
**Description**: [Description of selected strategy]

## Base Branch
**Primary Branch**: [main/develop/master/custom]
**Description**: All feature and task branches originate from this branch

## Branch Naming Patterns
Based on your selected strategy:
[Specific patterns for the selected strategy]

## Workflow
[Detailed workflow for the selected strategy]

## Merge Direction
[Where branches should be merged based on strategy]

---
*This configuration is used by all CCMagic git-related commands*
```

### 2. Creating `context/project.md`:
```markdown
# Project Name

## What We're Building
[Brief description of the project and its value proposition]

## Current Phase
- Sprint/Milestone: MVP
- Target Date: [TBD]
- Primary Goal: [Define initial goal]

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: [Framework/Library]
- Backend: [Language/Framework]
- Database: [Database System]
- Infrastructure: [Cloud/Hosting]

## Project Structure
```
[TBD]
```

## Development Commands
```bash
[TBD]
```

## Important Links
- Repository: [URL]
- Staging: [URL]
- Production: [URL]
- Documentation: [URL]
```

### 3. Creating `context/conventions.md`:
```markdown
# Development Conventions

## ID Format Convention
**Task IDs**: `XXX-YY-ZZZ-description`
- `XXX`: Epic number (e.g., 001 for first epic)
- `YY`: Feature number within epic (e.g., 01 for first feature)
- `ZZZ`: Task number within feature (e.g., 001 for first task)
- `description`: Brief kebab-case description

Example: `001-01-003-add-user-auth` = Epic 1, Feature 1, Task 3

## Git Workflow
**See `context/branching.md` for your project's configured branching strategy**

The branching strategy and base branch are configured during project initialization.
All git-related commands reference the branching.md configuration to ensure consistency.

## Commit Messages
Follow conventional commits:
   - `feat: Add user authentication`
   - `fix: Resolve login validation bug`
   - `refactor: Simplify error handling`
   - `docs: Update API documentation`
   - `test: Add auth service tests`
   - `chore: Update dependencies`

## Code Style

### Naming Conventions
[TBD]

### TypeScript/JavaScript
[TBD - Project-specific conventions]

## Testing Standards
- Write tests for new features
- Aim for 80% coverage minimum
- Test file naming: `*.test.ts` or `*.spec.ts`

## Documentation
- Update context files regularly
- Document key decisions in working-state.md
- Add JSDoc for complex functions
```

### 4. Creating `context/working-state.md`:
```markdown
# Working State

## Current Focus
- **Epic**: None
- **Feature**: None
- **Task**: None (completed or not started)
- **Last Updated**: [Today's Date]

## Active Work Hierarchy
### Current Epic
**ID**: None assigned
**Name**: N/A
**Status**: Not started

### Current Feature
**ID**: None assigned
**Name**: N/A
**Parent Epic**: N/A
**Status**: Not started

### Current Task
**ID**: None assigned (format: XXX-YY-ZZZ-description)
**Name**: N/A
**Parent Feature**: N/A
**Branch**: N/A

## Next Steps
1. Select an epic from `context/epics/`
2. Select a feature from `context/features/XXX-YY-name/`
3. Choose a task from the feature's `tasks/todo/` directory
4. Run `/start-task [task-id]` to begin
```

### 5. Creating `context/backlog.md`:
```markdown
# Backlog

## Creating CLAUDE.md in Project Root

```markdown
# Claude Code Instructions

This project uses the CCMagic System.

## Quick Start
1. Read `context/project.md` to understand the project
2. Read `context/conventions.md` for coding standards
3. Read `context/working-state.md` for current status
4. Check working-state.md for active task, load only that file

## Available Commands
- `/ccmagic:init` - Initialize CCMagic context (already done!)
- `/ccmagic:start-task [id]` - Start working on a task
- `/ccmagic:checkpoint` - Save progress
- `/ccmagic:complete-task [id]` - Complete a task
- `/ccmagic:handoff` - Create handoff notes
- `/ccmagic:add-backlog` - Add item to backlog

## Important Rules
1. Always create feature branches before changes
2. Update working-state.md regularly
3. Follow conventions.md strictly
4. Add ideas to backlog.md (don't implement)
5. Move completed tasks to tasks/completed/

## Context Structure
- Core files in context/
- Epics in epics/XXX-name.md (e.g., 001-mvp.md)
- Features in features/XXX-YY-name/ (e.g., 001-01-core/)
  - overview.md - Feature overview and scope
  - working-state.md - Current progress
  - tasks/todo/ - Planned tasks
  - tasks/current/ - Active task (usually just one)
  - tasks/completed/ - Finished tasks
- Spikes in spikes/ for research & one-off tasks
  - todo/ - Planned investigations
  - current/ - Active spike
  - completed/ - Finished research
- Knowledge base in knowledge/
- Sessions in sessions/

## Starting Simple
For solo developers or simple projects:
- Use one epic: `001-mvp`
- Use one feature: `001-01-core`
- Focus on tasks within that feature
- Add more epics/features only as needed
```

---

## Final Setup

Creating `.gitkeep` files in empty directories:
```bash
touch context/epics/.gitkeep
touch context/features/.gitkeep
touch context/features/001-01-core/tasks/todo/.gitkeep
touch context/features/001-01-core/tasks/current/.gitkeep
touch context/features/001-01-core/tasks/completed/.gitkeep
touch context/spikes/todo/.gitkeep
touch context/spikes/current/.gitkeep
touch context/spikes/completed/.gitkeep
touch context/sessions/handoffs/.gitkeep
touch context/knowledge/.gitkeep
```

---

## ‚úÖ Initialization Complete!

**Complete CCMagic Structure Created**

### Next Steps:
1. Update `context/project.md` with your project details
2. Update `context/conventions.md` with your team standards
3. Create your first task in `context/tasks/current/`
4. Run `/start-task [id]` to begin development

### Quick Reference:
- **Check status:** Look at `context/working-state.md`
- **Add ideas:** Update `context/backlog.md`
- **Start work:** `/start-task [task-id]`
- **Save progress:** `/checkpoint`

Your CCMagic context structure is ready for use!
