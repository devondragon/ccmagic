# Task Generation for Feature

## Implementation Plan

This command will:
1. **Feature Selection:**
   - If feature-path is provided: Use the specified feature
   - If no feature-path: List available features from `context/features/` and ask user to choose
   - Validate the feature exists and has an overview.md before proceeding

2. **Task Planning:**
   - Read the feature's `overview.md` from `context/features/[feature-path]/`
   - Check if mcp__zen__planner tool is available
   - If available: Use zen:planner to systematically break down the feature into tasks
   - If not available: Analyze feature scope and generate tasks interactively

3. **Create Task Structure:**
   - Generate granular, actionable tasks (2-8 hours each)
   - Create task files in `context/features/[feature-path]/tasks/todo/`
   - Update feature's `working-state.md` with task list and progress tracking

## Task Generation Strategy:
- **Step 1:** Determine which feature to work on (provided or selected)
- **Step 2:** Read feature overview to understand requirements
- **Step 3:** Use zen:planner (if available) for systematic task breakdown
- **Step 4:** Generate tasks considering:
  - Clear acceptance criteria for each task
  - Task dependencies and optimal ordering
  - Implementation tasks
  - Testing tasks
  - Documentation tasks
  - Integration tasks

## Task File Format:
Each task file (`task-XXX-description.md`) will include:
- Parent epic and feature references
- Clear description
- Acceptance criteria checklist
- Technical implementation notes
- Dependencies on other tasks
- Estimated time

## Output
Creates task files in feature's tasks/todo/ directory with time estimates.

## Notes:
- Tasks should be 2-8 hours each
- Number tasks sequentially (XXX-YY-ZZZ format)
- Consider task-000-setup.md if needed
