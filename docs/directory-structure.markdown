# CCMagic Directory Structure

## Overview

The CCMagic system uses a hierarchical context directory structure designed to maintain project clarity, enable efficient AI assistance, and support team collaboration. The structure follows a top-down organization from high-level epics to detailed tasks, with dedicated spaces for knowledge management and session tracking.

## Root Structure

```
project-root/
├── CLAUDE.md                    # AI assistant instructions and project-specific rules
├── context/                     # Main context directory (all project state lives here)
│   ├── project.md              # Project overview, tech stack, and key information
│   ├── conventions.md          # Coding standards and team agreements
│   ├── working-state.md       # Current sprint status and active work
│   ├── backlog.md             # Ideas, tech debt, and future improvements
│   ├── epics/                 # High-level feature groups and major initiatives
│   ├── features/              # Feature-specific directories matching epics
│   ├── spikes/                # One-off research and investigation tasks

### `/context/epics/`
**Purpose**: High-level feature groupings and major initiatives  
**Naming**: `epic-XXX-descriptive-name.md` (e.g., `epic-001-authentication.md`)  
**Contains**:
- Business value proposition
- User stories
- Success criteria
- Feature breakdown
- Technical approach
- Dependencies
- Effort estimates

**Example Structure**:
```
epics/
├── epic-001-authentication.md
├── epic-002-payment-processing.md
└── epic-003-admin-dashboard.md
```

### `/context/features/`
**Purpose**: Detailed implementation tracking for features within epics  
**Naming**: `epic-XXX-fNN-descriptive-name/` format  
**Why**: Supports one-to-many relationship between epics and features

**Structure Examples**:
```
features/
├── epic-001-f01-setup/           # First feature of epic-001
│   ├── overview.md               # Feature scope and architecture
│   ├── working-state.md         # Current progress and assignments
│   └── tasks/                   # Feature-specific tasks
│       ├── todo/                # Planned tasks
│       │   ├── task-003.md
│       │   └── task-004.md
│       ├── current/             # Active task (usually just one)
│       │   └── task-002.md
│       └── completed/           # Finished tasks
│           └── task-001.md
├── epic-001-f02-deployment/     # Second feature of epic-001
│   ├── overview.md
│   ├── working-state.md
│   └── tasks/
│       ├── todo/
│       ├── current/
│       └── completed/
└── epic-002-f01-login/          # First feature of epic-002
    ├── overview.md
    ├── working-state.md
    └── tasks/
        ├── todo/
        ├── current/
        └── completed/
```

**Naming Convention Breakdown**:
- `epic-XXX`: Parent epic number (e.g., `epic-001`)
- `fNN`: Feature number within epic (e.g., `f01`, `f02`)
- `descriptive-name`: Clear feature name (e.g., `login`, `setup`)

#### Feature Files Explained:

**`overview.md`**: Technical feature documentation
- Parent epic reference
- Feature scope and boundaries
- Architecture decisions
- Task summary and count
- Dependencies

**`working-state.md`**: Real-time progress tracking
- Feature status and timeline
- Task progress (in progress/ready/completed)
- Current focus areas
- Decision log
- Next sync schedule

**`tasks/`**: Feature-specific task directories
- **`todo/`**: Planned tasks not yet started
- **`current/`**: Active task (typically just one at a time)
- **`completed/`**: Finished tasks for reference
- Task files named: `task-XXX-description.md`
- Each task contains acceptance criteria, technical details, estimates

### `/context/spikes/`
**Purpose**: One-off research, investigation, and maintenance tasks not tied to features  
**Structure**:
```
spikes/
├── todo/                    # Planned investigations
│   └── spike-002-evaluate-caching.md
├── current/                 # Active research (usually just one)
│   └── spike-001-auth-libraries.md
└── completed/              # Finished investigations
    └── spike-000-deployment-research.md
```

**What Goes in Spikes**:
- Technical research and POCs
- Framework/library evaluations  
- Performance investigations
- Emergency hotfixes
- Dependency updates
- Learning/exploration tasks

**Spike File Format**:
- Spike ID and title
- Type (Research/Investigation/Maintenance)
- Time box (typically 4-8 hours max)
- Questions to answer
- Success criteria
- Findings/conclusions (when completed)

### `/context/knowledge/`
**Purpose**: Persistent technical documentation that spans features  
**Why**: Centralized reference that doesn't change with each task

**Standard Files**:
```
knowledge/
├── architecture.md      # System design and patterns
├── data-model.md       # Database schema and relationships
├── api-contracts.md    # API endpoints and contracts
├── business-rules.md   # Core business logic documentation
├── tech-debt.md        # Technical debt register with priorities
└── [domain-specific].md # Additional domain knowledge files
```

### `/context/sessions/`
**Purpose**: Track work sessions and enable smooth handoffs  
**Structure**:
```
sessions/
├── handoffs/           # Detailed handoff documents
│   └── 2024-01-15-auth-implementation.md
└── [date]-session.md   # Individual work session notes
```

**Session Files Include**:
- Task(s) worked on
- Progress made
- Decisions and discoveries
- Blockers encountered
- Next steps for continuation

## File Naming Conventions

### IDs and Numbering
- **Epics**: `epic-XXX-name` (e.g., `epic-001-authentication`)
- **Features**: `epic-XXX-fNN-name` (e.g., `epic-001-f01-login`, `epic-001-f02-registration`)
- **Tasks**: `task-XXX-description` within their feature's tasks directories
- **Spikes**: `spike-XXX-description` (e.g., `spike-001-auth-research`)
- **Sessions**: `YYYY-MM-DD-description` format

### Descriptive Names
- Use kebab-case for file names
- Be descriptive but concise
- Include relevant IDs for traceability

## Usage Patterns

### Starting New Work
1. Check `working-state.md` for current status
2. Select task from feature's `tasks/todo/` or spike from `spikes/todo/`
3. Move task to `current/` directory
4. Update working-state.md with task info
5. Work on implementation
6. Update progress in working-state.md

### Adding New Features
1. Create epic in `epics/epic-XXX-name.md` (if not exists)
2. Create feature directory `features/epic-XXX-fNN-name/`
3. Add overview.md and working-state.md
4. Break down into tasks in `features/epic-XXX-fNN-name/tasks/`
5. Multiple features can belong to the same epic

### Completing Tasks
1. Update task file with completion notes
2. Move from `current/` to `completed/` directory
3. Update working-state.md
4. Update feature working-state.md
5. Pick next task from `todo/` or create handoff

### Knowledge Management
- Document decisions in relevant working-state.md files
- Update knowledge base when discovering reusable patterns
- Keep architecture.md current with system changes
- Track tech debt actively in tech-debt.md

## Best Practices

### For Humans
1. **Update working-state.md frequently** - It's your primary communication tool
2. **Use backlog.md liberally** - Capture ideas without breaking flow
3. **Complete one task at a time** - Avoid context switching
4. **Document decisions** - Future you will thank present you

### For AI Assistants
1. **Always read working-state.md first** - Understand current context
2. **Load only active task files** - Minimize token usage
3. **Update files immediately** - Keep state synchronized
4. **Follow conventions.md strictly** - Maintain consistency
5. **Check CLAUDE.md for project-specific instructions**

## Scaling from Simple to Complex

### Simple Project Start (Solo Developer)
For a minimal viable setup:
```
context/
├── epics/
│   └── epic-001-mvp.md           # Single epic for entire MVP
├── features/
│   └── epic-001-f01-core/        # Single feature containing all tasks
│       ├── overview.md
│       ├── working-state.md
│       └── tasks/
│           ├── todo/
│           │   ├── task-002-feature.md
│           │   └── task-003-deploy.md
│           ├── current/
│           │   └── task-001-setup.md
│           └── completed/
└── spikes/
    └── todo/
        └── spike-001-framework-choice.md
```

### Growing Project
As complexity increases, add more features to the epic:
```
context/
├── epics/
│   └── epic-001-mvp.md
└── features/
    ├── epic-001-f01-core/        # Core functionality
    ├── epic-001-f02-auth/        # Authentication (added later)
    └── epic-001-f03-api/         # API endpoints (added later)
```

### Mature Project
Multiple epics with multiple features each:
```
context/
├── epics/
│   ├── epic-001-user-management.md
│   ├── epic-002-payments.md
│   └── epic-003-analytics.md
└── features/
    ├── epic-001-f01-registration/
    ├── epic-001-f02-login/
    ├── epic-001-f03-profile/
    ├── epic-002-f01-checkout/
    ├── epic-002-f02-subscriptions/
    └── epic-003-f01-dashboard/
```

## Benefits of This Structure

### Clear Hierarchy
Epics → Features → Tasks creates natural organization and traceability

### Flexible Scaling
- Start with one epic, one feature
- Add features as scope grows
- Add epics as project matures
- No refactoring needed when scaling

### Separation of Concerns
- Persistent knowledge (knowledge/) vs active work (tasks/, features/)
- Global tasks vs epic-specific tasks
- Current work vs completed work

### Efficient Context Loading
AI assistants can quickly understand project state by reading key files in order:
1. `project.md` - What are we building?
2. `conventions.md` - How do we build?
3. `working-state.md` - What's happening now?
4. Active task file - What needs to be done?

### Team Collaboration
- Clear handoff documentation
- Consistent file locations
- Self-documenting structure
- Progress visible at multiple levels

## Example Workflow

### Developer Starting Their Day
```
1. Read context/working-state.md
2. Check feature working-state if working on epic
3. Load specific task file
4. Begin work following conventions.md
5. Update working-state.md with progress
```

### AI Assistant Helping with Task
```
1. Read CLAUDE.md for project rules
2. Read context/project.md for overview
3. Read context/working-state.md for current state
4. Load specific task from working-state
5. Follow conventions.md for implementation
6. Update working-state.md after changes
```

### Team Lead Reviewing Progress
```
1. Check context/working-state.md for sprint status
2. Review features/*/working-state.md for feature progress
3. Check completed/ for recently finished work
4. Review backlog.md for upcoming priorities
```

## Maintenance Guidelines

### Daily
- Update working-state.md with progress
- Move completed tasks to completed/

### Weekly
- Review and prioritize backlog.md
- Update feature working-states
- Archive old session files

### Per Sprint
- Create new epic/feature structures as needed
- Update project.md with phase changes
- Review and update tech-debt.md

### As Needed
- Update conventions.md when team agrees on new standards
- Enhance knowledge base when discovering patterns
- Create handoff documents for significant work
