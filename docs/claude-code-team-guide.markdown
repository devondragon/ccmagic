## Core Philosophy & Principles

### The Five Pillars of Effective and Efficient AI-Assisted Development

1. **Context is Everything**: AI assistants have limited memory. Every byte matters.
2. **State Lives in Files**: Markdown documents are your persistent team memory.
3. **Clear Between Tasks**: Fresh context prevents confusion and errors.
4. **Right Model for Right Phase**: Strategic thinking vs. tactical execution.
5. **Structure Enables Scale**: Hierarchy and conventions multiply productivity.

### Why Traditional Development Breaks with AI

**The Context Problem**: AI assistants like Claude, GPT-5, or Copilot have a context window (memory) that fills up quickly. The more full it is, the slower, more expensive, and (if the context is not ALL directly related to your currnet task) the more error prone the AI gets. It's important to keep the context as clean, and tightly focused on the current task as possible.

**The Handoff Problem**: When a developer stops, critical information exists only in their conversation with the AI, making continuation difficult.

**The Consistency Problem**: Without structure, each developer uses AI differently, creating inconsistent code and approaches.

**The Scale Problem**: Ad-hoc AI usage works for small tasks but fails for complex, multi-person projects.

### The Solution: Structured AI Development Process

### Team Role Distribution

| Role              | AI Usage                | Recommended Model Type                           | Human Focus              |
| ----------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------ |
| **Product Owner** | Requirements refinement | Advanced (GPT-5 thinking, Claude Opus)           | Vision & priorities      |
| **Architect**     | System design           | Advanced reasoning (GPT-5 thinking, Claude Opus) | Technical decisions      |
| **Tech Lead**     | Task breakdown          | Advanced planning (GPT-5 thinking, Claude Opus)  | Feasibility & estimation |
| **Developer**     | Code generation         | Balanced (Sonnet 4, GPT-5)                       | Logic & testing          |
| **QA Engineer**   | Test generation         | Balanced (Sonnet 4, GPT-5)                       | Edge cases & validation  |

## Critical Context Management

### Understanding Context: Your Most Precious Resource

**Context is the AI's working memory during a session:**
- All files and code shared with the AI
- Previous messages in the conversation
- Outputs from executed commands
- The AI's understanding of your project state

### The Economics of Context

| AI Assistant      | Context Window | Typical File Impact | Session Duration |
| ----------------- | -------------- | ------------------- | ---------------- |
| **Claude Sonnet** | ~200K tokens   | 10-15 large files   | 4-6 hours coding |
| **GPT-4**         | ~128K tokens   | 6-10 large files    | 3-4 hours coding |
| **Claude Opus**   | ~200K tokens   | 10-15 large files   | Planning session |
| **Copilot Chat**  | ~16K tokens    | 2-3 files           | Single file work |

**Critical Insight**: A 5,000 line file consumes ~15-20K tokens. Loading unnecessary files wastes precious context!

### The Four Laws of Context Management

#### Law 1: One Task, One Context
```
❌ WRONG: "Now let's work on the authentication feature..."
         (After just completing database setup)

✅ RIGHT: 1. Complete current task
         2. Save progress to markdown
         3. Start fresh session
         4. Load only new task context
```

#### Law 2: State Lives in Files, Not Conversations
```
❌ WRONG: "Remember what we discussed about the API design?"

✅ RIGHT: Document decisions in:
         - context/knowledge/architecture.md
         - context/decisions/api-design.md
         - context/features/[feature]/overview.md
```

#### Law 3: Load Only What You Need
```
❌ WRONG: "Load all files in the src/ directory"

✅ RIGHT: "Load the specific task file and its dependencies:
         - context/working-state.md
         - context/features/auth/tasks/current/task-001.md
         - src/auth/login.ts (only if needed)"
```

#### Law 4: Checkpoint Before You're Forced To
```
Timeline of a typical session:
0-25%:   Fresh start, maximum efficiency
25-50%:  Good progress, still efficient
50-70%:  Time to checkpoint (save progress)
70-90%:  Prepare handoff, wrap up work
90-100%: Emergency save, session ends
```

## Three-Phase Development Process

### Overview: From Vision to Code

The three-phase process separates strategic thinking from tactical execution, ensuring each phase uses the optimal combination of human expertise and AI assistance.

```
Phase 1: Strategic Planning → Epics (Vision & Architecture)
Phase 2: Feature Design → Features & Tasks (Detailed Design)
Phase 3: Implementation → Code (Execution & Delivery)
```

### Why Three Phases?

1. **Different Thinking Modes**: Strategic planning requires different cognitive work than coding
2. **Different AI Models**: Planning benefits from advanced reasoning; coding needs speed
3. **Different Team Members**: Architects, designers, and developers each contribute
4. **Clear Handoffs**: Well-defined boundaries between phases prevent confusion
5. **Parallel Work**: Multiple team members can work on different phases simultaneously

---

## Phase 1: Strategic Planning & Requirements
*Product Owner & Architect Collaboration*

### Objective
Transform business vision into technical architecture and epic-level plans.

### Process

1. **Gather Requirements** (Human + AI)
   - Product owner describes business needs
   - AI helps clarify and structure requirements
   - Document user stories and success criteria

2. **Define Architecture** (Architect + AI)
   - AI suggests technology options
   - Architect makes strategic decisions
   - Document system design and constraints

3. **Create Epics** (Team + AI)
   - Break vision into 3-5 major epics
   - Each epic delivers significant value
   - Typically 2-4 weeks of team effort

### Deliverables

```

### Using AI in Phase 1

**Best Practices:**
- Use advanced models (GPT-5, Claude Opus) for strategic thinking
- Share business context and constraints with AI
- Have AI generate multiple options, human selects
- Document all decisions in markdown files
- Keep epic descriptions high-level (details come in Phase 2)

---

## Phase 2: Feature Design & Task Breakdown
*Tech Lead & Development Team*

### Objective
Transform epics into actionable features and tasks that developers can implement.

### Process

1. **Break Epics into Features** (Tech Lead + AI)
   - Each epic contains 2-5 features
   - Each feature delivers specific functionality
   - Typically 3-5 days of work per feature

2. **Design Features** (Tech Lead + AI)
   - Define technical approach
   - Identify dependencies
   - Document API contracts and data models

3. **Create Tasks** (Tech Lead + AI)
   - Each feature contains 3-10 tasks
   - Each task is 4-8 hours of work
   - Clear acceptance criteria

### Deliverables

```

- Provide epic context when creating features
- Have AI suggest task breakdown, human validates
- Ensure tasks are truly 4-8 hours (most common mistake: tasks too large)
- Document technical decisions in feature overview

---

## Phase 3: Implementation & Delivery
*Developers with AI Assistance*

### Objective
Transform tasks into working, tested, documented code.

### The Developer's Daily Workflow

```
Morning:
1. Review working-state.md (current status)
2. Select task from todo/ folder
3. Move task to current/ folder
4. Start fresh AI session

Development:
1. Load ONLY task file and dependencies
2. Implement with AI assistance
3. Test implementation
4. Save progress every 1-2 hours

Completion:
1. Update task with completion notes
2. Move task to completed/ folder
3. Update working-state.md
4. Create pull request
```

### Starting a Task: Best Practices

#### 1. Fresh Context for Each Task
```
❌ WRONG: Continue in same AI session from previous task
✅ RIGHT: Start new session, load only current task
```

#### 2. Load Minimal Context
```
What to load:
- context/working-state.md (current status)
- context/features/[feature]/tasks/current/task-001.md
- context/conventions.md (coding standards)
- Only the specific source files needed

What NOT to load:
- Entire src/ directory
- Unrelated features
- Completed tasks
- Historical discussions
```

#### 3. Document While Working
```
Every 1-2 hours, save:
- What's completed
- Decisions made
- Problems encountered
- Next steps
- Test results

Save to: context/sessions/2024-01-15-task-001.md
```

### Managing AI Sessions

#### Context Consumption Timeline
```
0-25%:   Fresh start, maximum efficiency
25-50%:  Good progress, checkpoint recommended
50-70%:  Save progress, prepare to wrap up
70-90%:  Create handoff, finish current work
90-100%: Emergency save, session ending
```

#### Creating Effective Handoffs

```markdown
# Handoff: Task 001 Docker Setup

## Status
70% complete

## Completed
- Dockerfile created and optimized
- Docker Compose configuration
- Basic service connectivity

## Remaining
- Configure hot reload
- Add volume mounts
- Update documentation

## Key Decisions
- Used Alpine Linux for smaller images
- Separated dev and prod configs
- Added health checks to all services

## To Continue
1. Run: docker-compose up
2. Fix hot reload in webpack.config.js
3. Test volume persistence
4. Update README with setup instructions

## Gotchas
- Port 5432 must be free (PostgreSQL)
- Need 4GB RAM allocated to Docker
```

### Using AI Effectively in Implementation

#### For Code Generation
```
✅ GOOD Prompts:
- "Implement the Docker setup according to task-001.md"
- "Add error handling following our patterns in conventions.md"
- "Generate tests that cover the acceptance criteria"

❌ BAD Prompts:
- "Build the entire authentication system"
- "Refactor everything to use TypeScript"
- "Make it work" (too vague)
```

#### For Problem Solving
```
✅ GOOD Approach:
1. Share specific error message
2. Show relevant code context
3. Explain what you've tried
4. Ask for systematic debugging

❌ BAD Approach:
- "It doesn't work, fix it"
- Loading entire codebase to find issue
- Not sharing error messages
```

#### For Code Review
```
Before committing, ask AI to:
1. Review for security issues
2. Check against coding standards
3. Suggest performance improvements
4. Identify missing error handling
5. Verify test coverage
```

## Model Selection Strategy

### Choosing the Right Model for Each Task

| Task Type              | Recommended Model  | Why                           | Context Usage |
| ---------------------- | ------------------ | ----------------------------- | ------------- |
| **Strategic Planning** | Opus / Gemini Pro  | Deep reasoning, architecture  | High          |
| **Feature Design**     | Opus               | Complex decomposition         | High          |
| **Task Creation**      | Sonnet             | Structured output             | Medium        |
| **Implementation**     | Sonnet             | Balance of speed & capability | Medium        |
| **Simple Fixes**       | Haiku              | Fast, cheap                   | Low           |
| **Code Review**        | Sonnet             | Thorough analysis             | Medium        |
| **Documentation**      | Sonnet             | Clear writing                 | Low           |
| **Debugging**          | Sonnet + zen:debug | Systematic approach           | High          |

### When to Override Default Models

```bash
# Complex architectural decision
/ccmagic:plan --model opus

# Simple configuration update
/ccmagic:start-task epic-001-f01-004-readme --model haiku

# Critical security review
/ccmagic:review --model opus
```

### Cost-Effective Model Usage

1. **Batch Similar Work**: Group tasks that need the same model
2. **Use Haiku for Simple Tasks**: README updates, config changes
3. **Reserve Opus for Critical Decisions**: Architecture, security
4. **Default to Sonnet**: Best balance for most development

## Team Workflows & Best Practices

### The Golden Rules

#### 1. One Task, One Context
```
✅ CORRECT:
- Complete current task
- Save state to markdown
- Start fresh AI session for next task

❌ WRONG:
- "Now let's work on the next task..."
- Continuing without clearing context
```

#### 2. Document Everything in Markdown
```
✅ CORRECT:
- Decisions → context/knowledge/decisions.md
- Progress → context/working-state.md
- Problems → context/sessions/[date].md

❌ WRONG:
- Keeping information only in AI chat
- Verbal handoffs without documentation
```

#### 3. Checkpoint Early and Often
```
Every 1-2 hours:
1. Save current progress to markdown
2. Document decisions made
3. List next steps
4. Commit work-in-progress if appropriate
```

#### 4. Follow the Hierarchy
```
Epic → Feature → Task → Code
  ↓        ↓       ↓      ↓
Vision  Design  Specs  Implementation
```

### Team Collaboration Patterns

#### Pattern 1: Feature Team
```
Architect: Creates epic-001-authentication
Tech Lead: Creates features f01-login, f02-oauth
Developer A: Implements f01 tasks
Developer B: Implements f02 tasks
Integration: Both merge to feature branches
```

#### Pattern 2: Task Swarming
```
Tech Lead: Creates all tasks for feature
Developers: Each take tasks from todo/
Daily: Sync on feature working-state.md
Integration: Continuous into feature branch
```

#### Pattern 3: Spike-First Development
```
1. Create spike for unknowns
2. Research with time box
3. Document findings in knowledge/
4. Create tasks based on spike results
5. Implement with confidence
```

### Handling Common Scenarios

#### Scenario: Context Limit Approaching
```
At 70% capacity:
1. Save current progress to markdown
2. Create detailed handoff document
3. Commit work-in-progress
4. Note "Continue in next session"
5. Start fresh for continuation
```

#### Scenario: Blocked on Dependencies
```
When blocked:
1. Document blocker in working-state.md
2. Add to backlog.md if it's a new requirement
3. Move task back to todo/ with notes
4. Select different unblocked task
5. Notify team of blocker
```

#### Scenario: Scope Creep Detection
```
New requirement appears:
1. Add to backlog.md immediately
2. Do NOT implement now
3. Stay focused on current task
4. Discuss in next planning session
```

#### Scenario: Complex Bug Found
```
Systematic approach:
1. Create spike task for investigation
2. Time-box the research (4-8 hours)
3. Document findings in spike file
4. Create specific fix tasks based on findings
5. Implement fixes as separate tasks
```

"Generate tasks for this feature, each 4-8 hours of work"
"What are the technical risks in this approach?"

For Implementation:
"Implement this task following the acceptance criteria"
"Add error handling using our standard patterns"
"Generate tests covering all edge cases"

For Debugging:
"Systematically debug this error: [paste error]"
"Trace the execution flow of this function"
"What could cause this behavior?"

For Review:
"Review this code for security issues"
"Check against our coding standards"
"Suggest performance improvements"
```

## Common Pitfalls & Solutions

### Pitfall 1: Context Pollution
**Problem**: Loading unnecessary files fills AI context
**Solution**: Load only the specific task file and direct dependencies

### Pitfall 2: Task Scope Creep
**Problem**: "While we're here, let's also..."
**Solution**: Add new ideas to backlog.md without implementing

### Pitfall 3: Lost Work
**Problem**: Context limit hit without saving progress
**Solution**: Save to markdown every 1-2 hours, before it's too late

### Pitfall 4: Unclear Requirements
**Problem**: Ambiguous task descriptions
**Solution**: Create spike tasks for investigation before implementation

### Pitfall 5: Inconsistent Documentation
**Problem**: Each developer documents differently
**Solution**: Use standard templates for all documentation

## Key Takeaways

### The Five Commandments of AI-Assisted Development

1. **Context is Sacred**: Never waste it, always manage it carefully
2. **Files are Truth**: Documentation in markdown is your source of truth
3. **Fresh Start for Each Task**: Clear context between work items
4. **Structure Enables Scale**: Follow the epic→feature→task hierarchy
5. **Checkpoint Constantly**: Save progress before you need to

### The Power of Structure

```
Clear Requirements → Defined Epics → Scoped Features →
Atomic Tasks → Focused Context → Efficient Development
```

### The Right Model Philosophy

- **Planning**: Use advanced models (GPT-4, Claude Opus) for deep thinking
- **Implementation**: Use balanced models (Sonnet, GPT-4) for coding
- **Simple Tasks**: Use fast models (Haiku, GPT-3.5) for simple work
- **Complex Problems**: Use specialized models with reasoning capabilities
- **Documentation**: Use models with good technical writing abilities
